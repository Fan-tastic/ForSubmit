This is a guessing game!

I put on the guessing subject about my previous job.

After my study in the Bootcamp I hope I could make:

1.  The international oil price(var answer) can be updated everyday by making a connection to a certain website.
2.  If the users input a string but not a number,  when the alert(Please insert a number!) comes out, they do not have to refresh and just show them the first prompt("Please insert a number") again.
3.  How to set how many times the users have to try to guess? so they also do not have to refresh the webpage.
